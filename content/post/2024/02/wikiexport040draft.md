I have a draft updated [WikiExport](https://github.com/phatcher/wikiexport) to NET 6/8 since NET 3.1 is EOL

This release also has a couple of bug fixes

* [Missing images causes export to fail](https://github.com/phatcher/wikiexport/issues/6)
* [Image paths not correct if no caption](https://github.com/phatcher/wikiexport/issues/5)

Have it as a beta release at the moment until a bit more operational testing has been done.
