A number of years ago Sebasiten Lorion wrote a very good CSV parser for .NET with the code and an accompanying article on Code Project - [A Fast CSV Reader](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9258/A-Fast-CSV-Reader").  I’d used this in a number of projects but recently I needed to make some changes to the code for my trading system project, and there wasn’t a public repository available; there’s a version on NuGet but it doesn’t point back to the source.

As the project is under the MIT Licence, I did the next best thing and made my own repository on GitHub – [CsvReader](https://github.com/phatcher/CsvReader) and there’s a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LumenWorksCsvReader/) as well
