Just recovering from flu at the moment and I'm an official Swine Flu statistic.

Not the nicest of bugs, couldn't keep any food down until the anti-virals kicked in but the funniest thing about the whole episode is the screening questionnaire to see if you qualify for the Tamiflu.

First question is whether you are enquiring on behalf of yourself or someone else, on being told I that I was asking for myself the call centre staff (apologetically) asked

"Are you conscious?"

Now I'm not sure if this is some form of modified Turing test, but I think this belongs on the other branch of the decision tree :smile:
