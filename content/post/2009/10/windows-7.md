Decided to take the plunge on Windows 7, as a test I've installed in on my wife's netbook (Samsung NC20) and if anything it's more responsive than under Windows XP.

Next decision is whether to go the whole hog and install the 64-bit version; the machine is fairly new, a Dell Precision 690, and I like the idea of having >4Gb of RAM for some of the projects I'm working on when I might have three copies of VS 2008 open at the same time.

I'll let you know how I got on.
