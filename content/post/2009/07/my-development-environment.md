One of the reasons I started this blog was to write down some of the stuff I've learnt over the past couple of years on how to structure my development environment so that it's easy to use and ties in nicely with things like continuous integration and automated testing.

So this is sort of a "head-up" of the topics I think I will be covering over the coming weeks..

* Tools choice
* Source control
* Project structure
* Binary dependencies
* Continuous Integration

It won't necessarily be in this order and I may throw some other stuff in if I find the inspiration
