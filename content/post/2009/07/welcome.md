Well I finally gave in and joined the blogging community.

This will be a general rant on technology, running a small software consultancy business and anything else that takes my fancy.

To give you all a bit of background I've been writing software for about 30 years now, having started on a mixture of home built (anyone remember the Tangerine MicroTan 65?) and early home computers includinng the Commodore Pet, Amstrad 1512, BBC Micro and Atari 1040ST.

First couple of commercial programs were a for the local pigeon racing club to work out race results, and a VAT return program for a friend of my dad.

Since then, I went to university (Computer Science at Brunel) and have spent the last 20 years writing commercial software in a variety of industries and a good mix of technologies, though these days I generally writing C#.
